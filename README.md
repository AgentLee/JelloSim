Jello Simulator using the Finite Element Method
===============================================

## Overview
This project implements a Jello Simulator using the Finite Element Method. The Finite Element method approximates the values of the unknowns (in this case, forces) at discrete points over the domain of the simulation. It does this by breaking down the problem into a number of really tiny simple problems, called finite elements. We treat these finite elements as their own systems that we solve individually to obtain a solution for the overall system. Because the finite element method uses approximations of the system at the discrete points its accuracy increase with smaller and smaller elements.

The simulator can actually represent a whole host of materials by specifing their Densities, Young's Modulus and Poisson's Ratio; We have however set it up with values that represent Jello.

Refer to the file labeled "USAGE_INSTRUCTIONS" for how to use the Simulator.
